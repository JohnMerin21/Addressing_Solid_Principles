# Addressing SOLID Principles in Software Development

## Overview
Welcome to the Addressing SOLID Principles assignment. This assignment aims to enhance understanding of SOLID design principles by applying them to a software development project. By identifying violations of SOLID principles in code and providing solutions to adhere to these principles, I aim to improve the design, maintainability, and flexibility of software systems.

## Selected SOLID Principles
The following SOLID principles have been selected for demonstration in this assignment:
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

## Use Case
For this assignment, I developed a unique use case scenario involving shapes and employees.

**Description**:
My assignment involves the development of two distinct modules: one for managing geometric shapes and another for managing employee data.

**Geometric Shapes Module**:
The Geometric Shapes Module is responsible for defining various shapes such as circles, rectangles, and triangles. It allows users to calculate the area and perimeter of these shapes.

**Employee Management Module**:
The Employee Management Module handles tasks related to employee data management, including adding new employees, updating employee details, and generating reports.

**Challenges**:
- The existing code for both modules suffers from violations of SOLID principles.
- In the Geometric Shapes Module, the design lacks adherence to the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) and the Open-Closed Principle (OCP).
- In the Employee Management Module, violations of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) are observed, leading to code that is difficult to maintain and extend.

**Project Objective**:
My objective is to refactor the existing codebase to adhere to SOLID principles. This involves restructuring the code to improve modularity, extensibility, and maintainability.

**Use Case**:
As part of the assignment, I will demonstrate violations of SOLID principles in the existing code and provide solutions to refactor the codebase. Each module will have both violated and refactored implementations, allowing for a clear comparison of the improvements made.

## Folder Structure
The project repository is organized as follows:
- `Violated`: Contains code demonstrating violations of SOLID principles.
- `Solved`: Contains refactored code adhering to SOLID principles.
- Folders for each selected SOLID principle containing implementations for both violated and solved versions.

## Instructions for Reviewing Code
1. Navigate to the `Violated` and `Solved` folders to find implementations for violated and solved versions of each SOLID principle.
2. Each SOLID principle folder contains code files demonstrating violations and solutions.
3. Detailed explanations and reasoning can be found within the code comments.

## Documentation
Detailed documentation about the violations, solutions, and the reasoning behind them can be found within the code comments.
