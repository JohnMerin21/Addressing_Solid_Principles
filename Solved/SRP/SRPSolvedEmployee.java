class Employee{
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String department;
}

//Employee class is responsible for managing employee data(properpeties, getters, setters, etc.)
// While the EmployeePrinter class is responsbile for printing employee details.
// Each class now has a single responsibility, adhearing to the SRP.

// This separation of concerns makes the code more modular, easier to understand, and maintainable.
